React Barebones
==============

Well, okay. Not even a skeleton, really. More like a bag of bones that you can use to make a skeleton. But it's a good bag.

This starter kit uses [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [JSPM](http://jspm.io/), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to provide an ES6 experience with ReactJS (which works well due to the object structure that React uses) powered by intelligent module loading. It uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its task runner, so you can get started easily.

Except for preferring Gulp, it's not opinionated. It won't force you into SASS, or LESS, or even my personal favorite, [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/). (Not opinionated at all.)

Finally, it uses the excellent [gulp-help](https://github.com/chmontgomery/gulp-help) plugin, so that you can easily get started with the tasks without having to look at the actual gulp files. Simply run `gulp` in your command line after pulling the project, and you'll know what you can do without having to consult a README or dig through task runner code.

That's about it. To get this working, git clone this repository, then run the following:

```shell
npm install -g jspm

Then, install your dependencies....

```shell
npm install && jspm install

After that, you're ready to go.
